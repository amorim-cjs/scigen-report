Thank you for the interesting in contributing to SciGen.Report!

This is an open source project that aims to foster communication around reproducing scientific papers. Contributions will be acknowledged on the readme file of this project.

If you want to contribute, here are the first steps to take:

1. Check whether there are open issues and code branches. While it is unlikely that no issue or code branch aside from Master is open, if none are available you can open an issue asking about current development.

2. Answer the discussion in an open issue that you believe you can help. You may have already made you contribution by cloning the repository and submitting a pull request, but we want to acknowledge contributions, so just a word introducing who you are and what you will do/did is really appreciated.

3. Join us with your contribution!

## Guidelines
If you submit a code review or implementation, leave security related arguments as default. If you introduce a new element, please mention it in an issue (eg., password hashing algorithm, hashing functions, hashing salt).
