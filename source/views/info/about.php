<p><b>SciGen.Report</b> is a community based platform with one mission:
to <b><a href="<?=BASE_URL . 'info/reproducibility'?>">foster communication on reproducibility</a></b> for the sound development of scientific knowledge.</p>
<!-- improving reproducibility in science.-->

<p>Reproducibility is the backbone of science and should be no less; without it, our knowledge about nature and the world would severely faulter. Thanks to it, we can say with confidence that new technologies will succeed in making a better world. New drugs are made thanks to reproduceable methods for synthesis. Their safety is reproduced everyday when we take medical treatments with no dangerous implications. Airplanes fly by reproducing findings from the lab, which must be rigorously repeated over and over again. 
</p>
<p>However, how do researchers know whether their peers are reproducing each others’ results? In fact, I'd say they don’t. The traditional path to communicate such attempts would rely on a laborous craft and submition of papers to a journal or conference, going through a long review process and with considerable cost, with no warrant that such information would be readily available. Alternatively, they can talk to their peers in different venues, what once again suffers the issue of not making this information easily available. While peer review is a valid and arguebly necessary process, it does not match nowadays speed of technology and communation. This is the gap SciGen.report comes to fill, offering <b>a swift and agile platform </b>where people can give their live status on paper reproduction efforts.
</p>
<p>The name SciGen (read “sci” like in “science” and “Gen” with a hard “g” as in “give” or “get”) is itself a multiple composition. ‘Sci’ comes from “science” (as one expects) and ‘Gen’ has its roots in “gens” or “genus” (kin) which also serve as root to words like “gene,” “gender,” “generate,” and so on. Because reproducibility is indelible as a genarator for science, and also a close kin to discoveries and development, this composition should capture the importance of reproduction. But also, this word comes as from transliteration of the Japanese word “<i>saigen</i>” (再現), which literally means “reproduction” or "replication" as is used for reproducing results and effects. “<i>Sai</i>” (再), in this case, means “again,” much like the “re-“ in “reprodrocude” or "replicate," while “<i>gen</i>” (現) means, among other things, “appear” or “show up.” As research should be, this name gains an international collaborative dimension, joining so-called East and West, and overlapping beautiful perspectives of two worlds in one word.
</p>
<p>Hence, SciGen.Report (read “SciGen Report”) becomes a diverse and multifaced name, at the same time meaning “reproducing report,” “report of a reproduction,” “science generator report,” “report of scientific kind,” and possibly other equally important readings. This name imprints our core values, namely, <b>diversity, integrity, and transparency</b>, in alphabetic order for none is above nor below another. It is in SciGen.report’s genes to embrace various opinions and efforts, of different scholar maturity or individual background, therefore equally welcoming  anyone: students, professors, women, men, Buddhists, Muslims, people from every ethnicity,  even cats and aliens if they are willing to work together for the common good. For this, no slandering  action can be tolerated and we believe scientific community can report their results, including negative ones, with collegial behavior and courtesy, while facing the facts as they are. And naturally, transparency is of paramount importance to keep the due positive ambient required for science.
</p>
<p>It is also in SciGen.Report’s understand that science has its direction reasonably stablished for the twenty-first century as being integrated to society. As stated in The Budapest Declaration on Science fo 1999, it proclaims: 1. Science for knowledge; knowledge for progress; 2. Science for peace; 3. Science for development, and; 4. Science in society and science for society. SciGen.Report enshrines the mission of bearer of the backbone of science in society. And through this role, we hope to become closer to the Sustainable Development Goals, and help to improve the life of the whole global society.
</p>
We are positive that transparent reproducibility will bring fruitful discussions and open paths for new technologies and engagements, that will make us closer to, if not eventually lead us, to the goals of a better world for everyone, and beyond.
